A Benchmark for the Comparison of 3-D Motion Segmentation Algorithms
IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2007

The main file of the implementation is ransac_subspaces.m. The file ransac_subspaces_test.m prepares and applies the algorithm to a simple subspace clustering problem.
